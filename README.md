![Logo](src/shield.png)


Time Shield is a productivity Chrome extension designed to help users manage their time spent on restricted websites more effectively. By tracking the amount of time spent on user-defined restricted sites, Time Shield encourages healthier browsing habits and enhances focus.

## Features

- **Website Restriction**: Users can define a list of websites (restricted sites) that they want to spend less time on.
- **Time Tracking**: Time Shield tracks the time spent on these restricted sites and displays it via a badge on the extension icon.
- **Daily Time Limits**: Set daily maximum allowed time for browsing restricted sites. Once the limit is reached, the user is notified.
- **Focus Mode**: Automatically stops the timer when Chrome loses focus or when navigating away from restricted sites, ensuring that time tracking is as accurate as possible.
- **Persistence**: Time spent on sites and remaining time are saved across browser sessions to keep track of user progress.
- **Notifications**: Alerts users when their allotted time for restricted sites has been exhausted.
